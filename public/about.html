<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>The Architect & The Investigator</h2>

<p>I am a Web Developer who believes that building a great website goes beyond just writing clean code. It requires understanding the entire digital ecosystem that surrounds it. My work sits at the intersection of creative development and security intelligence. While my primary focus is crafting responsive, high-performance websites and user interfaces, I differentiate myself by looking at the web through the lens of a security researcher.
</p>

<p>My technical foundation is rooted in the rigorous logic of Data Structures and Algorithms. I do not just use libraries; I study the underlying mechanics of sorting and searching to ensure the solutions I build are computationally efficient. This attention to detail allows me to bridge the gap between complex backend logic and seamless frontend design.
</p>
<p>However, what truly drives my curiosity is the unseen side of the internet. I am deeply passionate about Cybersecurity, specifically Ethical Hacking and Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT). I spend my time researching how digital footprints are created and analyzing the anonymity networks of the Dark Web to understand privacy at its core. I believe that to be a better builder, one must understand the tools and tactics of those who break systems. This dual perspective of builder and investigator allows me to approach web development with a "security-first" architecture, ensuring that the platforms I create are not just beautiful, but robust.
</p>
<p>Beyond the screen, I am a creative problem solver with a background in design. Whether I am automating a workflow, designing a book cover, or dissecting a complex SQL query, my goal is always optimization. When I am not coding, you will find me analyzing the geopolitical strategies in series like The Family Man or researching nutrition to hack my own biology for better performance.
